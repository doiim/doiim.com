                In 2009 we started developing mobile apps using a hybrid approach of native and web code. They reached
                more than 2 million downloads with freemium monetisation and 40 thousand daily users at peak usage. Due
                to the overall market conditions, we had to pivot and created a market-making Bitcoin arbitrage bot in
                2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our endeavour has always been bootstrapped due to the lack of venture capital in Brasil. In 2016 we
                started working as an outsourced contractor to foster our local community and finance our most ambitious
                products keeping us autonomous with skin in the game. An organic self-sustaining organization that
                doesn't have to act as a self-harming predator growing at all costs in order to have a return on
                investment.

                Our background is on Solidity, Javascript, Python, Java, TensorFlow, NoSQL, Node.js, Django.py, React,
                Vue, IPFS and containers. We assess the trade-offs of each approach and create a solution that satisfies
                by bringing a delightful and intuitive experience that resonates with the end user. 
                By solving a real problem and being laser focused on a valuable and measurable outcome, the service
                exempts itself from the need of growth hacking because it naturally thrives, being propelled by
                self-reinforcing network effects.

                The real potential of the web as an information tool is been underachieved. Innovation and the mass
                adoption of disruptive technology reside in our hands to create and consume at will. We are, for better
                or for worse, always on. And this is both part of the problem and part of the solution for how we evolve
                as individuals and as an information society in the age of integral syncretism.
